# Cat-image-Generate-Using-GAN
The goal of the GAN model is to generate realistic and diverse images of cats. GANs consist of two neural networks, a Generator, and a Discriminator, which are trained together in a competitive manner.

# GAN Cat Image Generation Model

## Overview

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating realistic cat images. The GAN consists of a Generator and a Discriminator, trained in a competitive manner to produce high-quality cat images.

## Requirements

### Hardware/Software Requirements:

- A computer with a GPU for accelerated model training.
- Python installed on your machine. Download from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Python Libraries:

- TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning capabilities:
  ```bash
  pip install tensorflow keras
  ```
- Matplotlib for visualizations:
  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib
  ```
- NumPy for numerical operations:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy
  ```
- OpenCV (optional for image processing):
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python
  ```
- TQDM (optional for progress bars):
  ```bash
  pip install tqdm
  ```
- Google Cloud SDK (if deploying on GCP):
  - Download and install from [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

### Dataset Requirements:

- Prepare a dataset of cat images for training the GAN.
- Ensure the dataset is well-organized, labeled, and accessible.

### Project Structure:

- Organize your project with the following files:
  - `main.py` (main application file)
  - `app.yaml` (defines runtime and settings for GCP deployment)
  - `your_model.pkl` (pickled model file, optional)
  - `requirements.txt` (list of dependencies)
  - Other project-specific files and directories.

### Additional Requirements:

- Trained Model (Optional for Deployment):
  - If deploying the model, ensure that your trained model (e.g., a saved TensorFlow/Keras model) is available.

- Google Cloud Platform Account (for deployment):
  - If deploying on GCP, you'll need a GCP account, a project, and the Google Cloud SDK installed.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-gan-cat-model.git
   cd your-gan-cat-model
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare your cat image dataset and place it in a directory named `dataset`.

4. Train the GAN model:

   ```bash
   python main.py train
   ```

5. Generate cat images:

   ```bash
   python main.py generate
   ```

## Deployment (Optional)

If you plan to deploy the model on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), follow the steps in the deployment section of your project.
